[00:09.70] Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[00:11.69] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[00:14.06] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[00:16.48] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[00:18.87] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[00:21.22] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[00:23.62] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[00:26.07] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[00:50.07] 
[00:28.76] I don't really know if she cares or not
[00:31.04] All I know is she left a lot of stuff in my apartment
[00:35.46] She's never getting back
[00:36.81] And as the smell on my pillow fades
[00:40.56] Her cigarettes might stay like a Roman Colosseum
[00:44.48] A dry and worthless monument to our love
[01:04.48] 
[00:48.76] Ooh, I still have your lighter
[00:51.25] Ooh, I still have your book
[00:53.53] Ooh, I still have everything you brought, but you never took
[00:58.54] You know where to find me
[01:00.80] And I know where to look
[01:12.80] 
[01:05.38] (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm not a-, not a crook-crook)
[01:07.14] Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[01:09.09] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[01:11.43] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[01:13.88] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[01:16.21] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[01:18.66] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[01:21.05] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[01:23.46] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[01:47.46] 
[01:26.12] I don't really know if she knows or not
[01:27.95] But I left some things in her jewelry box
[01:30.43] And she's wearing out my rings
[01:32.62] Taking the compliments meant for me
[01:35.04] And although I think I'll miss them
[01:37.30] At least there's proof of my existence
[01:40.30] A captive little soldier on her fingers
[01:43.81] Deep behind enemy lines
[01:55.31] 
[01:45.32] Ooh, I still have your lighter
[01:48.53] Ooh, I still have your book
[01:51.39] Ooh, I still have everything you brought, but you never took
[01:55.88] You know where to find me
[01:58.27] And I know where to look
[02:10.27] 
[02:01.05] (I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm not a-, not a-, I'm not a crook-crook)
[02:04.60] Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[02:06.43] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[02:08.84] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[02:11.26] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[02:13.59] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[02:15.99] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[02:18.31] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[02:20.80] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[02:44.80] 
[02:24.56] A copy of Gravity's Rainbow that she probably didn't read
[02:29.64] And how about my Laura Nyro record
[02:32.19] She probably threw away when she moved
[02:34.49] And how about the half a box of lentils
[02:39.03] From when I cooked her food
[02:41.00] That she probably didn't use
[02:55.00] 
[02:44.16] I want to dedicate this jam
[02:47.59] To all those things I left behind in girls' apartments
[02:49.87] And various domiciles over the years
[02:53.39] Sometimes you gotta leave in a hurry, man, what can I say?
[02:57.04] Except I didn't forget about any of it
[02:58.40] I'm taking it all back
[03:09.40] 
[03:01.81] Thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[03:03.89] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[03:06.11] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[03:08.52] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[03:10.90] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[03:13.33] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
[03:15.75] That's thievin', stealin', takin' what's not yours
[03:18.10] Takin' what's not yours, takin' what's not yours
